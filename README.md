# Jammin'

Jammin' is a web application that allows musicians to find jam sessions arround their location.

To run the project :

- Make sure to run npm i in both the client and the server folder to install required dependencies.
- In the server folder, run node index.js, the mongo db will be created under the name jammin', and the server will run on port 3001.
- In the client folder, you will need to create a .env file to host the Google Maps API:
  REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=yourkey

Hope you enjoy the app, any feedback/PR is appreciated !
